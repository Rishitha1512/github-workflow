**1. Project Scope**

*Main goal:*

Our team has a goal to create a functioning Unit Converter application, that will allow users to easily convert between different types of measure (i.e., length, weight, temperature) by the end of this sprint.

*Key features/deliverables:*

- User Interface with input fields for values and unit - with dropdowns to choose between different units.
- Includes conversion logic that accurately handles all of the categories and type of units.
- Will include displaying results clearly with the ability to reset or choose between the different units.
- Includes basic validation of user input to prevent errors.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile use.

*Out of scope:*

- No advanced units such as currency conversion or specialized scientific units (e.g. pressure, or energy) will be supported in this sprint.
- Features such as saving conversion history or user preferences will also be pushed to future sprints.

**2. Milestones and Timeline**

*By Game structure with Copilot:*

We want to map out the core conversion logic and units data structure, including some initial code snippets for unit groups and conversion formulas.

*By Mid-sprint demo + feedback:*

The goal is to have the basic prototype ready for team demo and feedback, where the converter has working UI at least for two units and basic conversion capability.

*Final sprint demo:*

By the end of the sprint we will want to have completed all of the targeted units, a finished UI, basic validation for inputs, and bug fixes based on mid-sprint demo/feedback.

*Additional checkpoints:*

We will have daily stand-ups for progress monitoring and a planned code review after the features are implemented and before final submission.

**3. Team Roles and Responsibilities**

- *Rishitha (Team Leader and Planning)*: I have overall responsibility for team coordination, project timeline and keeping the project aligned with the sprint goals, assigning tasks, and facilitating conversations with the team and resolving blockers in a timely manner to ensure project progress.

- *Paul (UI/UX Design using CSS)*: Paul is responsible for a user-friendly and visually rich interface, including app layout, styling, and determining the app's responsiveness using CSS. He will manage an unconfused, clean, user interface.

- *Yohan (Functionality using JavaScript)*: Yohan will develop all functionality related to the unit converter. This includes developing the conversion logic, developing user input/output, as well as ensuring all interactive aspects of the app performs correctly.

- K*aran (Testing and Debugging)*: Karan will manage the testing process by identifying bugs, testing the app relevant to different use cases, along with ensuring all the appropriate unit conversion takes place. He will also help manage the app stability and performance before the final demo.

*Roles flexibly assigned*: Each of us will have fixed roles based on what is best suited the individual as much as possible, but we agreed that we support each other and rotate the work irrespective of whatever project roles are assigned on the group discussion.

*Communication*: We will communicate on a daily basis with check-ins via whatsapp, and we will have sit together when possible to discuss troubleshooting. Through the use of shared documents and GitHub, we will be able to keep everyone working toward the same objectives.

**4. Anticipated Challenges and Strategies**

*Challenges:*

- Taking care of edge cases in conversions, for example large or small numbers, or invalid input.
- Integrating the front-end and back-end code with a seamless transition between the two pieces.
- Time management for the current sprint in meeting deadlines and dealing with unforeseen bugs along the way.

*Strategies:*

- Be very clear with unit tests in the early stages to spot conversion errors early on.
- Be clear about the front-end and the logic module so the integration is not confusing.
- Provide ample planning time before the final deadline for debugging and thorough testing.
- Keep communication open to address blockers as they arise.
